# GALP Output Files Reference

This document describes the directories and files generated by GALP during execution. Output files depend on the selected workflow, enabled options, and whether the molecular dynamics evaluation step completes successfully.

The output files are written to the working directory or to the directory specified by `Input Files Path`.

## Contents

1. [DL_poly_BS Directory](#dl_poly_bs-directory)
2. [GALA_Output Directory](#gala_output-directory)
3. [Binding Site Output Files](#binding-site-output-files)
4. [Diagnostic and Error Files](#diagnostic-and-error-files)


## DL_poly_BS Directory

Directory generated by GALP to compute guest–host interaction energies for each binding site using DL_POLY Classic.

Two types of subdirectories are created within `DL_POLY_BS`:

1. **Guest_bs_0000**  
   Subdirectories following this naming scheme correspond to individual binding-site configurations, where the numerical index identifies the binding-site number. Each of these directories contains the DL_POLY input and output files used to compute the interaction energy for that specific binding site.

   Upon successful DL_POLY execution, the following files are produced in each binding-site directory:
   - FIELD  
   - CONFIG  
   - CONTROL  
   - STATIS  
   - OUTPUT  
   - REVCON  

2. **framework_guest**  
   Subdirectory containing the host framework with no bound guest molecule. This calculation is used to determine the reference framework energy.

   In this reference calculation:
   - Guest charges are set to zero.
   - The resulting energy is subtracted from the total energy of each binding-site configuration.

   This procedure ensures that the reported binding energies reflect only guest–host interactions.

### Notes

- If DL_POLY terminates successfully, intermediate output files are removed before GALP finishes
- If DL_POLY fails for any binding site, the `DL_POLY_BS` directory is preserved for inspection, along with the generation of the `DL_POLY.output`, more on this later.

## GALA_Output Directory

### GALA_Output/

Directory generated by GALP containing all processed binding-site information. This directory is created whenever binding site identification completes successfully.

## Binding Site Output Files

### `<guest>_binding_sites.cif`

Binding sites written in CIF format and ordered by decreasing relative occupancy. Each site corresponds to a fitted guest configuration located within a high-probability adsorption region.

This file is suitable for visualization, comparison with experimentally reported binding sites, and provides a physically meaningful first approximation of guest locations within the framework. As such, it serves as a convenient starting point for subsequent electronic structure calculations, including DFT based geometry optimizations and binding energy analyses.

### `<guest>_binding_sites_optimized.cif`

Binding sites written in CIF format after DL_POLY optimization (only produced when `Optimize Binding Sites (OBS)` is enabled). This file contains the MD optimized binding-site geometries and is ordered by decreasing relative occupancy.

### `<guest>_binding_sites_fractional.xyz`

XYZ file containing the fractional coordinates of all binding sites within the unit cell. This representation is useful for symmetry analysis and mapping sites across periodic boundaries.

### `<guest>_galp_binding_sites.xyz`

XYZ file containing the Cartesian coordinates of each binding site, ordered by decreasing occupancy. In addition to atomic coordinates, this file reports:

- Total binding energy (Ebind, kJ/mol)  
- van der Waals energy contribution (Evdw, kJ/mol)  
- Electrostatic energy contribution (Eesp, kJ/mol)  
- Electrostatic contribution percentage (esp, %)  
- Relative occupancy (occ, %)  

```bash
3
 BS: 0, Frame: 0, Ebind= -10.095002, esp= 14.96%, Evdw= -8.585002, Eesp= -1.51, occ= 100.00%
Cx    C         3.334622   -16.732927     2.519689         0.000574768 
Ox    O         2.343244   -16.732927     3.100525         0.0001960866 
Ox    O         4.326000   -16.732927     1.938853         0.0001980285 
```

This is the primary output file used for energetic analysis and ranking of binding sites.

### `<guest>_guest_information.xyz`

XYZ file containing all site maxima extracted from the probability density maps, listed in order of increasing occupancy. For each maximum, both Cartesian and fractional coordinates are reported along with the corresponding occupancy magnitude.

This file is intended for detailed analysis and post-processing.

### `<guest>_local_maxima.cif`

CIF file containing the raw local maxima extracted directly from the atomic probability density maps, prior to any pruning, grouping, or molecular fitting.

This file is useful for debugging, parameter tuning, and assessing the quality of the probability distributions.

## Diagnostic and Error Files

### `galp.log`

Log file recording operations, status messages, and diagnostics produced during the GALP run. This is the primary file to inspect when troubleshooting missing outputs or unexpected behavior.

### `galp.err`

Error file capturing warnings and errors that would otherwise be printed to the command line. This file is useful when running high-throughput workflows where stdout and stderr are redirected.

### `tanimoto.txt`

Text file reporting Tanimoto similarity metrics for probability grids (when enabled or produced by the workflow). This file is typically used to assess convergence or similarity between probability distributions.

### `entropy.txt`

Text file reporting entropy metrics derived from probability grids (when enabled or produced by the workflow). This file is typically used to quantify distribution spread or compare adsorption phase behavior.

### `DL_POLY.output`

Diagnostic file generated when DL_POLY encounters an error during execution. This file reports the DL_POLY error code and the binding-site configuration associated with the failure.

If DL_POLY terminates successfully for all binding sites, this file is deleted automatically before GALP completes.
